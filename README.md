## Calibration
- Best Way to calibrate is from the webpage
- Buttons might not work correctly initially. Calibrate from Webpage...
- Gyro/Accelerometer Calibration can be triggered both by 3 sec button press or webpage.
- Button/Mag calibration can only be triggered from webpage.
- If in doubt reset settings from webpage... (That will force a button recalibration on next start...)
