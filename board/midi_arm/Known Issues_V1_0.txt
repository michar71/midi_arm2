Known Issues
------------
1) Touch Pad TOUCH3 connected to pin 11 whihc uses ADC2 which cannot be used together with WiFi
2) Pin 12 routed to extension header was supposed to be used with Touch-Pad but is also connected to ADC2
3) Pin 16/18 where supposed to be used with Tension Strip resistors are also connected to ADC2

We can tempeorarily fix this by attaching these pins to the inner uC board header row to use ADC1 only:
- Connect Pin 11 to Pin 10 (ADC 1_9)
- Connect Pin 16/18 to pin 1/2
